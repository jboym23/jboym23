### I have had a bit of coding experience in the past, but it has been a bit.  

In the summer leading up to my eigth grade year, I took a six-week high-school-level computer programming course. There, I specialized in the learning fundamentals of Processing. I learned a lot, and at the time I felt very comfortable with it. I used my knowledge to create my eighth grade Science Fair project. However, it has been a few years since I have applied my computer science knowledge, so I have understandably forgotten a lot of what I had learned.

By taking AP Computer Science Principles, I hope to regain a lot of the knowledge I once had, plus more. I hope to also expose myself to more languages that I am currently unfamiliar with. I have a feeling I will catch on quickly due to my prior understanding -- I am really rusty, though. I especially look forward to continue using java-based languages, as I love computer-generated art, and java specifically suits art very well. I would love to create some sort of complex art generator by the end of the course.

Outside of computer science, I also am interested in many STEM-related subjects. From physics to calculus to engineering, I love anything dealing with numbers. However, I also enjoy learning Mandarin, playing the oboe, doing karate, and much more. 

I am looking forward to a great year.
